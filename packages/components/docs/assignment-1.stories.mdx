# Assignment 1

## 1.1 Schema

_Study file: `<root>/packages/graphql-server/src/schema.grapghql`._

_Go to <a href="http://localhost:4000" target="_blank">http://localhost:4000</a> and click "Query your server"._

All queries are automatically documented by Apollo and can be viewed on the left side.

## 1.2 Products Query

Currently the Query is empty ("Operation" panel in the middle). You can manually type fields (with autocompletion ctrl + space) or
click the fields in the "Documentation" panel.

_Create a query named "Products" that retrieves the first 6 products with all the fields needed for <a href="http://localhost:6006?path=/docs/components-molecules-product--primary" target="_blank">this</a>
component. Variables: "page": 1, "size": 6._

## 1.3 Cart Query

_Create a new tab and repeat the previous steps to query the CartProducts for <a href="http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/components-molecules-cart-product--primary" target="_blank">this</a>
component. Variables: "page": 1, "size": 20._

## 1.4 Mutations

It's time to mutate the data on the server. Queries and mutations are defined in the root of the schema which can be accessed by clicking "root"
or back in the Documentation panel.

_Create a new tab and implement the "addToCart" mutation. Variables: "id": "10", "quantity": 2. Run the mutation and query the Cart to see if it works._

_Create a new tab and implement the "updateCart" mutation and change the quantity of the added product. Run the mutation and query the Cart to see if it works._

_Create a new tab and implement the "removeFromCart" mutation and remove the added product. Run the mutation and query the Cart to see if it works._
